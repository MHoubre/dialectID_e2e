# Dialect embeddings for VarDial 2018 challenge
The dialect embeddings are extracted from the last hidden layer which has 600 activations. <br>
VarDial 2018 challenge information can be found at http://alt.qcri.org/vardial2018/ <br>
Dialect identification can be done using SVM based classifier at here https://github.com/qcri/dialectID<br>
